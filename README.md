# Beetle CLI
Beetle is a command-line application (Java) that started as an ETL tool (hence the
"ETL" in the name), but now provides two pieces of functionality:

* Execute a SQL query and save the results to an output file
* Generate fake data and save the results to an output file

Both options support the same output file formats:

* CSV
* JSON
* TOML
* YAML
* XML
* SQL (INSERT statements)
